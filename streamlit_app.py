            I cuddled the pillow looking dejected,
            lonely night with the loud aching soul
            feeling drained, feels nothing sense at all.
            Evening sounds felt solitary and out of things, 
            doesn't make snap decisions but does overthink. 
            Brood over things that goes wrong,
            can't stay in the moment when all my thoughts are running circle for what future will bring.

            Am I gonna make it? What would be my potential condition? Am I gonna feel the bliss that genuine smile of eyes? if not, this feeling well stay melancholic, blues of life with teary eyes? I know I am the only one who can mold my foreseeable future. It always between the inner success and inner failure. The choice is mine if I take a risk and move on to the misc. 

            Constantly in my mind to keep forward with diligence and not be dramatic over things. Am I hypocrite to know what will be the state of being open, if I never do the right ways? if I never choose the path that was bright and happy? cause I always stuck of thinking but I never find myself apply it in reality. I can't let go being in the safe place, my comfort zone, it sucks and it made me sick. I feel locked in isolated mind. Screaming my lungs for relief but found myself dismay and dysphoric.
